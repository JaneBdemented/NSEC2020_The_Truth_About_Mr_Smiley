# The Truth About Mr. Smiley Walkthrough

There are many ways to go about solving this challenge, some more creative than others. The following is just one of the many possible methods.

## Synopsis
In an attempt to snag a copy of the upcoming Geography midterm, we stumbled upon a strange truth about our teacher. The student newspaper “The Severity High Tattler” wants an exclusive on what you found, but you need to gather all the evidence you can before they can go to print.

# Solution

After downloading and extracting the challenge player were faced with the following 3 files:

	- mrsmiley.lime
	- module.dwarf
	- README

The README included the following information:

```
Managed to get you the dwarf dump, but your gonna need to get the System map on your own. Wonder what kernel release it might be?
```
A little research and we can quickly discover that the .lime extension can be related back to the Linux Memory Extractor [LiME](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME). A little more and we can discover that we can use a memory forensics tool called [Volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility) to analyze this file. However, Volatility requires a profile associated with the system the memory was extracted from. The profile consists of two files:

	1. module.dwarf - containing the kernel's data structures. (this file was supplied)
	2. System.map - debug symbols for the kernel we want to analyze.

This is are first problem, we need to get the correct system map, one that matches the kernel running on Mr. Smiley's computer.

## Determining the Correct System.map

This requires a bit of digging in a massive binary file, the simplest way I could think of was to simply grep for the linux version:

```
$ grep -wa 'Linux version' mrSmiley.lime
```
Now, sure we are gonna get more then we need out of this, but right off the bat we get exactly the information we are looking for.

![output1](img1.png)

From the output above we can determine the system map we need has the following criteria:
	
	- Ubuntu 5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2-generic
	- 64 bit
	
Now we need to get a copy of the system map. The best way to get it is directly from the Ubuntu repository: 

[kernel-image-5.3.0-51-generic-di\_5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2\_amd64.udeb](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-hwe/kernel-image-5.3.0-51-generic-di_5.3.0-51.44~18.04.2_amd64.udeb)

We can extract the system map from the archive, zip it together with the module.dwarf that was given and add it to volatility (/volatility/plugins/overlays/linux/Ubuntu5.3.0-51.zip). You can then test your volatility to make sure it is seeing your profile:

```
./vol.py --info | grep Linux
```
## Analyzing the Memory

Now that we have a working profile, it's time to dig in! 

Because of the size of the lime file, it will take volatility some time to execute a plugin (averaged about 7 min for me, but this is dependent on the plugin and the system you're running on).

### Flag Geo 1

To retrieve the first flag use the plugin linux\_lsmod, this will list all the loaded modules. _(A simpler way to retrieve this flag is simply to run strings on the file and grep for FLAG)_

```
$ ./vol.py --profile=LinuxUbuntu5_3_0-51x64 -f ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/mrSmiley.lime -vd linux_lsmod
```
This gives the following output:

```
There we have the first flag __FLAG{3XTR@CT10N_M0DUL3}__.

### Flag Geo 2

This flag takes a couple of steps.

__First: Looking at the bash\_history__

``` 
$ ./vol.py --profile=LinuxUbuntu5_3_0-51x64 -f ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/mrSmiley.lime -vd linux_bash
```
Output:

```
 2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   ./truecrypt-7.1a-setup-x64 
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   ls -la 
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   ifconfig
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   ifconfig
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo apt install build-essentials
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo truecrypt -d
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo apt install libc6-dev
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   ??xl?N!%
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   reboot
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo truecrypt -k syllebus_X_scoringKey.pdf geo_syllebus_X.pdf 
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo apt install libc6
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo truecrypt 
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo insmod lime-5.3.0-51-generic.ko "path=tcp:4444 format=lime timeout=0"
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   P??y
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   ls
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo truecrypt -k syllebus_X_scoringKey.pdf geo_syllebus_X.pdf 
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   ifconfig
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   sudo apt install build-essential
    2817 bash                 2020-05-10 07:21:08 UTC+0000   ifconfgi
```

Looking at the bash\_history we can note a very telling line:

```
sudo truecrypt -k syllebus_X_scoringKey.pdf geo_syllebus_X.pdf
```

According to the TrueCrypt manual the ```-k``` flag indicates a key file, so these two files might not be PDFs at all. So next we need to extract these two files if we can.

__Locating the syllebus\_X\_scoringKey.pdf and geo\_syllebus\_X.pdf files__

``` 
$ ./vol.py --profile=LinuxUbuntu5_3_0-51x64 -f ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/mrSmiley.lime -vd linux_enumerate_files > Files.text
```
Output: [Files.text](Files.text)

From this we can see where the two files are located:

```
     Inode Address Inode Number              Path
------------------ ------------------------- ----
0xffff8f718c0a0d90                   3014670 /home/mrsmiley/syllebus_X_scoringKey.pdf
0xffff8f72011c37c0                   3014681 /home/mrsmiley/geo_syllebus_X.pdf
```
Now we have enough information to extract them:

``` 
$ ./vol.py --profile=LinuxUbuntu5_3_0-51x64 -f ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/mrSmiley.lime -vd linux_find_file --inode=0xffff8f718c0a0d90 -O ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/syllebus_X_scoringKey.pdf
```

``` 
$ ./vol.py --profile=LinuxUbuntu5_3_0-51x64 -f ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/mrSmiley.lime -vd linux_find_file --inode=0xffff8f72011c37c0 -O ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/geo_syllebus_X.pdf
```
Then we can take a look at Mr. Smiley's disguised TrueCrypt volume. _(If you don't have TrueCrypt you can get a copy [here](https://www.grc.com/misc/truecrypt/truecrypt.htm))_

Unlocking and mounting the TrueCrypt volume, we see the following files:
```
.
├── AlwaysAndForever.txt
├── CadyBaby.jpeg
├── image3.jpeg
├── image4.jpeg
├── image6.jpeg
├── image7.jpeg
├── imgae5.jpeg
└── Plastics.jpeg
```
Reading Mr. Smiley's disturbing love letter to Lindsay Lohan's Mean Girls character Cady we find the second flag: __FLAG{1-H3@RT-L1ND5@Y3}__

### Flag Geo 3

What better way to learn someone's secrets than to take a little dive into there emails. From the previous flag, we got a list of files from the dump. Exploring this list a little closer, we can see that Mr. Smiley is running the Thunderbird mail client. From his Local Folders we can sneak a peek at his Trash folder.

![image7.png](image7.png) 
``` 
$ ./vol.py --profile=LinuxUbuntu5_3_0-51x64 -f ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/mrSmiley.lime -vd linux_find_file --inode=0xffff8f720200f708 -O ~/Downloads/mrSmiley/LocalMailTrash
```
Here we can find a telling email with the following body:

```

anted harassment activities, or the equivalent thereof, that has been on-go=
ing in recent weeks. Therefor, you are required to cease and desist all ver=

Cleaning up the formatting, replacing ```=0A``` with ```\n\r```, and reconnecting lines split with ```=``` the letter becomes much easier to read.
```
Dear Mr. Smiley

This letter has been served as a notice of your unwarranted harassment activities, or the equivalent thereof, that has been on-going in recent weeks. Therefor, you are required to cease and desist all verbal and digital attacks, including but not limited to: 
- Online stalking of Ms Lohan.
- Emails and social networking communications to any of Ms Lohan's accounts.
- Telephone calls to Ms. Lohan.
The previous conducted actions are unwanted, unwelcome, and have become unbearable. Due to the aforementioned harm you have caused, this cease and desist shall serve as a pre-suit letter demanding that you provide us written assurance within 30 days that you will refrain from further actions that could be deemed as harassment.

Sincerely,

Hamelton & Ivanivatch Lawfirm

The strange run of letters and numbers after the lawyer's address deserves some further investigation. A quick trip over to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and we quickly identify this as the base64 encoding of __FLAG{CR@53D-5T@LK3R!}__

### Flag Geo 4

For this flag we need to explore Mr. Smiley's browser history. If we take a look at the ```/home/mrsmiley/.mozilla/firefox/obu0qcyo.default-release/places.sqlite``` file there is a little hint waiting for us.

![browserHistory](image3.png)

When we go to h4csquared.org we see the following:

![h4csquared](image4.png)

However, it looks like this site is using cookies. Maybe we can get lucky and Mr. Smiley's cookie is still valid, which means we need to find his cookie first. We come up short in the ```/home/mrsmiley/.mozilla/firefox/obu0qcyo.default-release/cookies.sqlite``` but all is not lost, ```/home/mrsmiley/.mozilla/firefox/obu0qcyo.default-release/sessionstore-backups/recovery.baklz4``` gives us another (slightly more difficult) way to get our hands on the desired cookie. 

Using a tool like [Fx File Utilities](https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html) we can give this file a lot more human-readable meaning, allowing us to discover right at the bottom the info we are looking for:

```json
{
	"host":"h4csquared.org",
	"value":"b63oc298jm5o8kjmacgacbst93",
	"path":"/",
	"name":"PHPSESSID",
	"originAttributes":
	{
		"firstPartyDomain":"",
		"geckoViewSessionContextId":"",
		"inIsolatedMozBrowser":false,
		"privateBrowsingId":0,
		"userContextId":0
	}
}
```

Now if we head over to h4cSquared.org, open our developer tools and replace our PHPSESSID with the one given above "b63oc298jm5o8kjmacgacbst93". We can then reload the page and see what it was Mr. Smiley was looking at:

![flag](image6.png) 



### Flag Geo 5

There are many quick and dirty ways to discover this flag _(this is why the point value was low)_, for simplicity's sake, given that you already have access to the places.sqlite file and you know the original reason for investigating Mr. Smiley's computer was to get your hands on a copy of the Midterm test. You can use the URL with the title "Midterm Test" from the places.sqlite file and paste it into your browser:

![midterm](midterm.png)

From here you can see the important part of the document. However, __SYNT{F3PE3G5-Y05G}__ is the right format but not the right letters. Any CTF veteran should quickly realize that __SYNT__ is simply a ROT13 shift of __FLAG__. Shifting the full value we get the final flag __FLAG{S3CR3T5-L05T}__.

_Credit to the solution of this flag goes to the teams who reached out to me while solving this flag! This was a much simpler way then I had planned for this flag! Cheers!_
